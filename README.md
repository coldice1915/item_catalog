## Introduction
Modern web applications perform a variety of functions and provide amazing features and utilities to their users; but deep down, it’s really all just CRUD -- creating, reading, updating and deleting data. In this project, I'll combine my knowledge of building dynamic websites with persistent data storage to create a web application that provides a compelling service to my users.


## Technologies
Git • HTML • CSS • Flask • Python 2.7.16 • Psycopg 2.8.3 • Vagrant 2.2.0 • VirtualBox 6.0.10


## Setup
### 1. Install VitualBox 
Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Install the platform package for your operating system.

### 2. Install Vagrant
Download [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). Install the version for your operating system.

If Vagrant is successfully installed, you will be able to run `vagrant --version`   in your terminal to see the version number.

### 3. Download the VM configuration
Download and unzip this file: [FSND-Virtual-Machine.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/April/5acfbfa3_fsnd-virtual-machine/fsnd-virtual-machine.zip).
(Alternately, you can use Github to fork and clone this [repository](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm).)

### 4. Start the virtual machine
In your terminal, `cd` to the `/vagrant` directory and run the command `vagrant up` to start the Ubuntu Linux installation.

When it is finished running, run the command `vagrant ssh` to log in.

## What have I done?
- [x] You will learn how to develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication. You will then learn when to properly use the various HTTP methods available to you and how these methods relate to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.

Efficiently interacting with data is the backbone upon which performant web applications are built
Properly implementing authentication mechanisms and appropriately mapping HTTP methods to CRUD operations are core features of a properly secured web application
